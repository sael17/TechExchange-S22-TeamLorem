# TechExchange-S22-TeamLorem
Unit 4 (Full Stack Website) Project: Goal Up by Team Lorem 

# IMPORTANT
In order to work in the project, make a branch from main and ONLY and just ONLY merge with main when the feature you are working has been tested and it works how it is supposed to work. Heroku redeploys when a push is made to the main branch, so this is to make sure the deployed app does not break.

# Deployed App Link
[team-lorem-goal-up.herokuapp.com](https://team-lorem-goal-up.herokuapp.com/)

## Setup: 
In order to run the app in vscode, run the following commands:
- ``python3 -m venv venv`` to setup a python virtual environment.
- For Windows: ``./venv/Scripts/activate`` to run the *venv*.
- For MacOS/Linux ``. /venv/bin/activate`` to run the *venv*

**Sidenote:** To exit out of the *venv*, type ``deactivate``. 
## Install packages:
To install all dependencies do ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

To install a python package do ``pip install <package_name>``

To update the *requirements.txt* file do ``pip freeze --local > requirements.txt``

## Run the app:
``flask run`` to run the app while the *venv* is active

**Note:** Always run the command after doing ``.venv/<Scripts or bin>/activate``
